                        and to discuss their
                        utility in specific patients and clinical scenarios. The effectiveness of periodontal treatments, the associated
                        duration of healing, a potential for reduction of pain and post-operative scarring, and optimization of clinical
                        results
                        may be improved for patients through such techniques.</p>
