        <h2>Dental Health of Kid</h2>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>When should a child first be seen by a dentist?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>1 year old. It is generally recommended that an infant be seen by a dentist by 1 year of age or within 6 months after the first tooth comes in.</p>
        </div>    
    

        <h2>Oral Health</h2>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>Halitosis is the medical term for oral condition?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Bad breath, medically called halitosis, can result from poor dental hygiene and may be a sign of other health problems. Bad breath can also be made worse by the types of foods you eat and other unhealthy lifestyle habits.</p>
        </div>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>Poor dental health is linked to many serious diseases and conditions. True or False?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>True. Some studies have linked common oral problems to illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, premature birth, osteoporosis, and even Alzheimer's disease. In most cases, the strength and exact nature of the link is unclear, but researchers suggest that dental health is important for preserving overall health.</p>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Black hairy tongue is a deadly oral disease. True or False?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>False. The name -- black hairy tongue -- may sound scary, but the condition is actually harmless. Black hairy tongue is caused by bacteria or fungi in the mouth, which make the tongue appear black and hairy. It's easily remedied by good old-fashioned oral hygiene.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Oral cancer that is caught early is treatable and curable. True or False?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>True. Oral cancer presents as a mouth sore that doesn't go away and can be accompanied by unexplained numbness in the face, mouth, or neck. There may be problems chewing, speaking, or swallowing. Don't let fear keep you from the doctor -- oral cancer that is caught early is treatable and curable.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>How often should I replace my toothbrush?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Every 2 to 3 months. The American Dental Association recommends throwing out your toothbrush every three to four months. If the bristles become frayed, you're sick, or you have a weak immune system, throw it out even more often. If you use an electric toothbrush, throw out the head as often as you'd discard a disposable toothbrush.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>What type of toothbrush and toothpaste should I use?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Buy toothbrushes with soft bristles. Medium and firm ones can damage teeth and gums. Use soft pressure, for 2 minutes, two times a day.</p>
            <p>Both powered and manual toothbrushes clean teeth well. Manual brushes with mixed bristle heights or angled bristles clean better than those with all flat, even bristles. Powered toothbrushes may be easier if you have trouble using your hands.</p>
            <p>Set a reminder to replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months. Toss it sooner if the bristles look bent or splayed out. Bent bristles don't clean as well. (They're also a sign you may be brushing too hard).</p>
            <p>Most toothpastes will clear away bacteria growth and acids from food and drinks. Toothpastes with the American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance always have fluoride, which strengthens and protects teeth. If you want a non-fluoride option, stores carry toothpastes and powders made with natural ingredients that don't have ADA testing and approval.</p>
            <p>If cold or hot food or drinks make you cringe, pick a toothpaste for sensitive teeth and let your dentist know.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>What are early signs of dental trouble?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Visit a dentist if you have any of these issues or see your child having trouble chewing or complaining of soreness:</p>
            <p>- Mouth sores</p>
            <p>- Jaw pain</p>
            <p>- Redness</p>
            <p>- Swollen face or gums</p>
            <p>- Tooth sensitivity</p>
            <p>- Broken teeth</p>
            <p>- Dry mouth</p>
            <p>- Bleeding gums</p>
            <p>- Bad breath or a bad taste in your mouth</p>
            <p>Getting checked out right away prevents more serious problems and infections.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion"><b>Why do I need dental exams?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Regular exams help spot trouble early to prevent bigger and more costly treatments later.</p>
            <p>A dental hygienist will start by cleaning buildup from your teeth. Then the dentist will probe spots on the surfaces and near the gumline with special tools. If it's been a while between appointments, you may have some sore and sensitive areas.</p>
            <p>You should get an exam every 6 months, or more often if your dentist recommends it. Find one who makes you feel at ease and lets you know what to expect. Often the dread of seeing the dentist turns to big relief when the visit is over and you have a care plan set up. Being positive as a parent can help your kids overcome any of their fears.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Are dental X-rays safe and needed?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Medical and dental experts study the use of X-rays and set limits for their safety. Your dentist should take as few as possible. Sometimes dentists may recommend X-rays to diagnose a special problem. Advancements in technology means today's digital X-rays release much less radiation and are safer than in the past.</p>
            <p>Expect to get them during a first exam after not seeing a dentist for a while. This helps check tooth and gum health. If you have gum disease, the dentist may want pictures every 6 months. For regular check-ups, it's about every 2 years, depending on your dentist's plan.</p>
            <p>Kids have more X-rays done than adults because their teeth are changing and because they get cavities more easily.</p>

        <h2>Tooth</h2>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>What causes tooth decay?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Acid. Tooth decay occurs when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches) are left on the teeth. Bacteria that live in the mouth digest these foods, turning them into acids. The bacteria, acid, food debris, and saliva combine to form plaque, which clings to the teeth. The acids in plaque dissolve the enamel surface of the teeth, creating holes in the teeth called cavities, or dental caries.</p>
        </div>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>Tooth loss is an inevitable part of aging. True or False?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>False. "Although tooth loss is common, it's not an inevitable part of aging," says Richard H. Price, DDS, a retired dentist in Newton, Mass., and spokesman for the American Dental Association. "Teeth do not die a natural death -- we kill them. Exactly how do we do that? In short, by disease or trauma," he says.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Do I really need to floss?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>There's no getting around the need to get around your teeth daily with dental floss. It clears food and plaque from between teeth and under the gumline. If you don't, plaque hardens into tartar, which forms wedges and widens the space between teeth and gums, causing pockets. Over time, gums pull away and teeth loosen.</p>
            <p>Either waxed or unwaxed floss will do the job. Using floss picks or interdental brushes is another easy option.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Do teeth need fluoride?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Fluoride helps make teeth strong and prevents decay. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Dental Association (ADA), and the CDC all agree that kids should use fluoride toothpaste for brushing, taking care not to swallow it.</p>
            <p>Adults benefit from using fluoride to protect their teeth, too.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>How do fillings work?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Cavities break through the surface enamel of teeth, and they'll probably get bigger unless you close them off with fillings.</p>
            <p>Your dentist will numb your mouth before drilling around the cavity to prep it. A combination of strong materials or a white mix called a composite goes into the cavity soft and then hardens as it dries. You may feel pain or pressure when getting the numbing shot and during the drilling.</p>
            <p>Once set, fillings can last a long time but need replacing if they break or wear down.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>What do sealants do?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Sealants protect against cavities that can form in the natural tiny holes and cracks on the outside of teeth. Kids from about 6 to 12 benefit from having sealants painted and hardened onto the chewing surfaces of their back teeth, or molars. Adults can get sealants as well to protect teeth that don't have fillings.</p>
            <p>Dentists or dental assistants put sealants on in an office visit, and it's painless. They last around 2-4 years.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>What's the best way to whiten my teeth?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Stores sell many whitening products, and you can get take-home gels and trays from your dentist, but neither is as strong as procedures done in a dental office</p>
            <p>If you want to try an over-the-counter whitener, look for one with an ADA seal. Check with your dentist for advice before you buy, especially if you have dental work or dark stains. And don't keep using them, or you could damage your teeth.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>How can I fix my teeth and smile?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Caps and crowns cover problem teeth by surrounding them in a material that looks like a real tooth. They use the root and inside of the tooth as a base to build on, then attach with special cement.</p>
            <p>Veneers and bonding improve your smile by sticking a layer of smoother and whiter materials like porcelain or resin to the natural tooth.</p>
            <p>Talk with your dentist about which fix is right for you.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Are sweets and ice really bad for my teeth?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, sweets and foods with acid, like candy and soda, could stick to teeth and lead to cavities. Smoking and chewing tobacco can cause oral cancer and gum disease.</p>
            <p>While teeth are strong enough to chew ice and tear open packages, this can break them and stress your jaws. Gritting or grinding down on teeth when you're stressed may crack them.</p>
            <p>Biting your nails is another bad habit. It pulls your jaw out of position and changes how your teeth fit together.</p>
        </div>
    

        <h2>Gum</h2>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>What is the best way to prevent gum (periodontal) disease?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Remove plaque. Gum disease can be prevented by removing plaque. Plaque removal can be easily accomplished by thoroughly brushing and flossing your teeth daily. Regular dental check-ups (every 6-12 months) can detect early signs of gum disease.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Which of the following usually precede(s) gum disease (periodontal disease)?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Gingivitis. Gingivitis (gum inflammation) usually precedes periodontitis (gum disease). In the early stage of gingivitis, bacteria in plaque buildup causes the gums to become inflamed (red and swollen) and often easily bleed during tooth brushing. Although the gums may be irritated, the teeth are still firmly planted in their sockets. No irreversible bone or other tissue damage has occurred at this stage.</p>
